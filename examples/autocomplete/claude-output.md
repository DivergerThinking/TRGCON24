I'll explain different ways to leverage GitHub Copilot's autocomplete capabilities, with examples for each approach:

1. Line-by-Line Completion:
```python
# Start typing:
def calculate_average
# Copilot should suggest completing the line with parameters and return type:
def calculate_average(numbers: List[int]) -> float:
```

2. Docstring to Code:
```python
# Write a docstring and let Copilot generate the implementation:
def sort_students_by_gpa(self) -> List[Student]:
    """
    Sort all students in the registry by their GPA in descending order.
    Returns a list of students from highest to lowest GPA.
    """
    # Copilot should suggest the implementation
```

3. Function Signature to Implementation:
```python
# Write just the function signature and let Copilot complete:
def find_students_in_course(self, course_name: str) -> List[Student]:
    # Copilot should suggest the entire implementation
```

4. Comment-Driven Development:
```python
# Write descriptive comments and let Copilot implement:
# Find all students with a GPA above 3.5 and send them a congratulatory email
def notify_honor_students(self):
    # Copilot should suggest the implementation
```

5. Test Case Generation:
```python
# Write test function names or comments:
def test_student_gpa_calculation():
    # Create a student with known grades
    # Calculate GPA
    # Assert expected results
    # Copilot should suggest the full test implementation
```

6. Pattern Completion:
```python
# Start a common pattern and let Copilot complete:
class StudentNotFoundException(Exception):
    # Copilot should suggest the implementation
```

7. Error Handling Pattern:
```python
# Start writing error handling:
try:
    student = self.get_student(student_id)
    # Copilot should suggest the except blocks
```

8. Data Structure Pattern:
```python
# Start defining a data structure:
student_data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    # Copilot should suggest additional relevant fields
```

9.  Type Hint Completion:
```python
# Start with type hints:
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def process_grades(
    # Copilot should suggest parameter types and return type
```

10.  Bulk Method Generation:
```python
# Write multiple method names and let Copilot implement them:
def get_top_performers(self, n: int) -> List[Student]:

def get_course_average(self, course_name: str) -> float:

def get_student_ranking(self, student_id: int) -> int:
```


Tips for effective Copilot usage:

1. Be descriptive in your comments and function names
2. Use type hints to get more accurate suggestions
3. Write detailed docstrings before implementation
4. Start with common patterns and let Copilot complete them
5. Use consistent naming conventions to help Copilot understand context
6. Break complex functions into smaller, well-named functions
7. Use explicit variable names that suggest their purpose

Would you like me to provide more specific examples for any of these approaches or demonstrate other patterns?
